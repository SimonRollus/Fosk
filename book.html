  <p>I'm scared, why? seems a question to ask but i don't what answer you?
  It's because the world move to fast for me or else I'm a twenty years old girl who worked in a diner for repay his student loan.
  For medical studies, I've totally failed by the way.
So, you're probably asking yourself how i could screw up my life so bad</p>
